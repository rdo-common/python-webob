To use version 1.2.1 of python WebOB it is nescesary
to explicitly load it so as not to get the system version
of WebOb. 

Manually modifying sys.path is an easy and reliable way
to use this module.

>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/WebOb-1.2.1-py2.7.egg')
>>> import webob
